# Task: User management system
We have designed a coding task that is intentionally vague and open-ended in its specification so that you have the opportunity to take it in almost any direction you wish.
Stories.

- As an admin I can add users — a user has a name.
- As an admin I can delete users.
- As an admin I can assign users to a group they aren’t already part of. • As an admin I can remove users from a group.
- As an admin I can create groups.
- As an admin I can delete groups when they no longer have members.
-  Design a convenient API that other developers would love to use for the tasks above.
